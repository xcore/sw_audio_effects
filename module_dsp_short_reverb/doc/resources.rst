Resource Requirements
=====================

Available Memory
----------------
This application uses variable amounts of memory depending on the size of the delay-line,
(used to produce the echos) and the number of channels being processed. 
In module_dsp_short_delay/src/delay_line.h. 
A #define MEM_SAMPS is used to indicate the amount of memory available for the delay-line.
Currently this is set at 12000 samples, which uses almost all the available memory on Tile_0.

Used memory(Bytes) is about:
   * codememory:  5K
   * datamemory: 49K

Computation
-----------
``module_dsp_biquad``, and ``module_dsp_loudness``, run in their own logical cores (aka threads).
Therefore, refer to the documention in those modules for computation details on those functions.

The Reverb-Control logical core is timing critical, 
The channel I/O had to be hand-crafted to get the application working on 4 channels.

The Reverb echos are produced using a 4 tap delay-line.
The reverb has configurable mixing parameters.
There are currently 4, each one requires a multiply. That is 4 multiples/sample/channel.
For a 48 kHz sample rate, on a 500 MHz processor, the composite Reverb_control/Delay-line requires
1250 cycles/sample per channel.
